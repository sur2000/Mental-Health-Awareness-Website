# Mental-Health-Awareness-Website 
This is the website of the Mental Health Awareness. It is designed to be responsive on a variety of devices and accessible from different web browsers, 
providing ease-of-use to potential viewers who wish to learn about mental health, help themselves in their mental struggles, help others who face mental 
struggles, or support campaigns promoting mental health awareness.

The goal for this project was to create a single website where users with different needs can retrieve information on mental health without having to surf 
through multiple webpages. 

Right now, it is difficult to find a single platform that offers educational value for people who have never faced or even heard about these issues and at 
the same time offers practical help for the ones who have a great deal of experience with such problems and are looking for ways on resolving them. 

Since mental health issues are exceptionally prevalent in modern society, and since stigma leaves the victims of mental illnesses belittled, misinformed, 
and uneducated, we attempted to create a website within which users can access resources to educate themselves, help themselves, help others, and spread 
awareness on mental health.  

On our website, users can easily navigate across different pages to find the information that they are looking for depending on their interests within the 
area of mental health and mental health awareness.
